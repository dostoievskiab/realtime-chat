# Chat with Socket.IO
## 1. Introduction
I started this project a long time ago (Dec/2017). I wanted to know if was possible to create a simple chat using my knowledge with javascript, html and css.

Going through this repository I decided to polish my solution using some knowledge I gained over the years.

## 2. How to run 
- Install NodeJS
- Inside this folder run in command line `npm install`
- Then run `npm run test`
- You can access the application on website http://localhost:5000
